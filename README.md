# Product Landing Page

## Overview

![screenshot](./assets/product-landing-page-demo.png)

A mobile first, fully responsive landing page for an app named Meet. The page was built to be fluid and responsive across all viewports; two breakpoints were created to strategically compliment the content, and a small amount of JavaScript was used to implement a simple scroll button and download modal. Care was taken to ensure that smooth scrolling and CSS transitions were applied across devices to maximize UX.
